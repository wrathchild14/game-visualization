## Notes

Running the `index.html` file doesn't work, the project must be run in some different way...

## Setting up

- The main program is `games_visualization.js` and it uses `JavaScript` and the `p5.js` library https://p5js.org/
- For running I used the `Live Server` from `Visual Studio Code` extensions, but every live server approach works (tested `python -m http.server` also works)

## Visualization

- To answer the question of visualization? This program has fun visualizations about the sales of videogames through the years. Please view the page in full screen mode.
    - We are greeted with a cricle which has lines and points of all the global sales of games sorted by release year.
    - If we hover over the points we can see the title and developer of the game on the center of the circle and some additional info on the side.
    - We can click on each point for a better view of the game with the full info, if we hover our mouse outside of the circle, we will get to the previous/original view of the page.
    
## Viewing

For easier viewing I uploaded the project to the p5js editor to share it.

- https://editor.p5js.org/jovanprodanov123/sketches/Oov204OS3 - for editing the project
- https://editor.p5js.org/jovanprodanov123/full/Oov204OS3 - for viewing the project on fullscreen (which I recommend)
